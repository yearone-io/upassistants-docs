# UP Assistants

The Universal Assistant Protocol (UAP) is a rule engine catalog through which Universal Profiles (UPs) can engage virtual assistants to automate tedious, repetitive, and mundane tasks associated with incoming or outgoing transactions. The UAP enhances the Web3 user experience by empowering users to granularly control and respond to actions directed at them by others.

The possibilities for the types of assistants that can be built are boundless â€“ from spam management to automated DeFi protocol interactions, personal finance, and building games with on-chain components. We are building the protocol to be modular, scalable, and upgradeable so that Universal Profiles can engage different assistants for the same types of transactions, and new assistants can be easily developed and integrated by anyone. This approach not only addresses current issues but also anticipates future needs, ensuring that the Universal Assistant Protocol remains a vital tool for empowering users in the decentralized web.
