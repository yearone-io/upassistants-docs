# UP Assistants: Digital Assistants For Everyone

In a not-too-distant tomorrow, people own sleek, digital identities called **Universal Profiles (UPs)** on LUKSO. These UPs house everything from collectibles to social tokens, making them the beating heart of each individual’s on-chain life. Yet as these profiles grow, so do the complexities of managing who sends what—and why.

Enter the **Universal Assistant Protocol (UAP)**, a powerful new layer that ensures every incoming asset or transaction to your UP gets the attention it deserves. When something arrives—like an NFT or a cryptographic message—the **UAP’s Universal Receiver Delegate (URDuap)** steps in as the dedicated concierge. It checks a registry of your chosen “Executive Assistants,” specialized mini-contracts trained to handle tasks you’ve defined in advance, such as automatic tipping, forwarders, or specialized refining for certain tokens.

Soon, these Executive Assistants will be joined by “Screener Assistants,” vigilant watchers that can evaluate each incoming transfer and decide if it should be allowed, blocked, or modified. Think of it like a trusted guard at your digital door, ensuring only the transfers that match your exact preferences get through—so unwanted tokens or tricky spam never clutter your identity.

Over time, the UAP turns your Universal Profile into something more than an address—it becomes a curated experience, shaped by your own rules and logic. Whether you automatically tip creators, refine game tokens into premium rewards, or simply filter out spam, the UAP coordinates it all in a smooth, transparent way. It’s the next step in forging truly intelligent on-chain identities, where **you** decide exactly how assets, messages, and possibilities flow into your life.
