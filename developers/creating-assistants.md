### Creating and Integrating a New Executive Assistant

#### 1. Overview

An **Executive Assistant** is any contract that implements the `IExecutiveAssistant` interface. When the **Universal Receiver Delegate (URDuap)** is triggered in the Universal Profile (UP), it will:

1. Look up which Executive Assistants are associated with the `typeId`.
2. Call each Assistant’s `execute(...)` function, passing in context about the current transaction (`upAddress`, `notifier`, `value`, `typeId`, and `data`).
3. Receive back instructions on what operation to perform via the UP’s `ERC725X.execute(...)` function, plus optionally updated `value` and `data` for subsequent Assistants.

By implementing the `IExecutiveAssistant` interface, you gain access to a powerful extension point to customize how certain incoming transfers or messages are processed.

***

#### 2. Implement the `IExecutiveAssistant` Interface

Your custom Executive Assistant **must** implement the following function signature:

```solidity
function execute(
    address upAddress, 
    address notifier, 
    uint256 value, 
    bytes32 typeId, 
    bytes memory data
)
    external 
    returns (
        uint256 operationType, 
        address target, 
        uint256 execValue, 
        bytes memory execData, 
        bytes memory newDataAfterExec
    );
```

* **`upAddress`**: The UP address that is delegating this call to the URDuap.
* **`notifier`**: The contract or account that triggered the universal receiver (e.g., a token contract sending LSP7/LSP8 tokens).
* **`value`**: The amount of native tokens (e.g., LYX) sent with the transaction.
* **`typeId`**: A bytes32 value identifying the type of incoming asset or event.
* **`data`**: Additional data relevant to the transaction (as forwarded by the token contract or the caller).

You must return:

1. **`operationType`**: The type of `IERC725X.execute` operation (0 = `CALL`, 1 = `CREATE`, 2 = `CREATE2`, etc.).
2. **`target`**: The address on which the UP will execute the operation (`execTarget`).
3. **`execValue`**: The amount of native tokens sent along with this operation.
4. **`execData`**: The encoded call data to execute on `target`.
5. **`newDataAfterExec`**: Arbitrary bytes that become the `data` parameter for the **next** Assistant in the chain (if any). This is how you can pass along updated context or instructions.

> **Note**: Returning `(0, address(0), 0, "", data)` would effectively mean "do nothing except pass along the `data`," which can be useful if your Assistant only updates `value` or modifies the data for the next Assistant but does not need to call an external contract.

***

#### 3. Storing and Reading Configuration

Often, your Assistant needs additional settings or instructions (for example, a recipient address, a percentage, or a specific token ID). Because Assistants run in their **own** contract context when called by the URDuap, they can:

**Use the UP’s ERC725Y Storage**

* Store configuration under a known key derived from your Assistant’s address.
* For example, the code uses a key like `UAPExecutiveConfig:<assistantAddress>` to store arbitrary settings.
*   You can read from the UP’s storage with something like:

    ```solidity
    IERC725Y upERC725Y = IERC725Y(upAddress);
    bytes32 settingsKey = // e.g., keccak256("UAPExecutiveConfig") combined with assistantAddress
    bytes memory settingsData = upERC725Y.getData(settingsKey);
    // decode settingsData to retrieve your config
    ```

**Example** (taken from `TipAssistant`):

```solidity
bytes32 settingsKey = getSettingsDataKey(address(this));
bytes memory settingsData = upERC725Y.getData(settingsKey);

(address tipAddress, uint256 tipPercentage) = abi.decode(
    settingsData, 
    (address, uint256)
);
```

In this example, the Assistant expects the user to have stored `(tipAddress, tipPercentage)` in the UP’s ERC725Y store. If that data is missing or invalid, the Assistant reverts or defaults.

***

#### 4. Adding Your Assistant to a `typeId`

1.  **Compute the Key**: The URDuap uses:

    ```solidity
    bytes32 typeConfigKey = LSP2Utils.generateMappingKey(
        bytes10(keccak256("UAPTypeConfig")),
        bytes20(typeId)
    );
    ```

    to locate an array of Executive Assistant addresses for a given `typeId`.
2.  **Encode an Array of Addresses**: The URDuap’s `customDecodeAddresses` function expects:

    * **First 2 bytes**: The number of addresses (in `uint16`).
    * **Then**: Each address in 20 bytes (no padding, just consecutive addresses).

    You can encode this on the client side or in a script. For example (in JavaScript/TypeScript, pseudo-code):

    ```ts
    function encodeAssistants(addresses: string[]): string {
      const num = addresses.length;
      const hexCount = num.toString(16).padStart(4, '0'); // for uint16
      // encode addresses in hex
      let encoded = '0x' + hexCount;
      addresses.forEach(addr => {
        encoded += addr.replace(/^0x/, '');
      });
      return encoded;
    }
    ```
3.  **Set the Data** in the UP:

    ```solidity
    IERC725Y(upAddress).setData(typeConfigKey, encodedAssistants);
    ```

Once the `typeId` is mapped to your Assistant(s), the URDuap will automatically invoke them in the specified order whenever a transaction arrives with that `typeId`.

***

#### 5. Best Practices & Considerations

1. **Keep Logic Focused**
   * Each Assistant should do **one** well-defined task (e.g., tipping, refining, forwarding, etc.).
   * Complex or multi-step logic might be split into separate Assistants for clarity and composability.
2. **Handle Missing or Invalid Configuration Gracefully**
   * If your Assistant depends on config in `ERC725Y` that might not exist, consider reverting with a clear error message or defaulting to a safe no-op.
3. **Reverts vs. Bubbles**
   * If your Assistant fails (reverts), the entire URDuap flow reverts. Decide carefully whether to revert or to continue with partial success.
   * Provide meaningful revert reasons or error events to help users debug.
4. **Avoid Unbounded Loops**
   * The URDuap will invoke each Assistant in order. If your Assistant triggers additional loops or calls that might be unbounded, you risk hitting gas limits.
5. **Beware of Re-entrancy**
   * If your Assistant performs external calls with non-trivial logic, consider re-entrancy safeguards (e.g., checks-effects-interactions pattern).
   * Typically, `IERC725X.execute(...)` calls can be considered safe, but be mindful of external calls your Assistant might make.
6. **Gas Efficiency**
   * Keep the computation in `execute(...)` as minimal as possible to avoid large overhead in normal UP usage.
   * Store only necessary data on-chain.
   * Consider using well-optimized libraries for encoding/decoding if your logic is complex.
7. **Test Thoroughly**
   * Write unit tests and integration tests against your custom Assistant.
   * Verify correct behavior when receiving different `value`, `typeId`, or `data`.
8. **Security Audits**
   * Because Assistants can instruct the UP to execute arbitrary operations, a bug in your Assistant can lead to unexpected or dangerous calls.
   * Make sure to audit for any potential logic flaws or vulnerabilities.

#### 6. Example: Creating a New “MyCoolAssistant”

Below is a minimal example of a new Assistant that might:

* Read a stored “recipientAddress” from the UP’s ERC725Y data.
* Always forward a fixed portion of `value` to that recipient.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import {IExecutiveAssistant} from "./IExecutiveAssistant.sol";
import {IERC725Y} from "@erc725/smart-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IERC725Y.sol";
import {ERC165} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol";

contract MyCoolAssistant is IExecutiveAssistant, ERC165 {
    // Custom error for no configuration found
    error NoConfigFound();

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) 
        public view override(ERC165) 
        returns (bool) 
    {
        return interfaceId == type(IExecutiveAssistant).interfaceId 
            || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }

    function execute(
        address upAddress, 
        address /*notifier*/, 
        uint256 value, 
        bytes32 /*typeId*/, 
        bytes memory data
    )
        external 
        override 
        returns (
            uint256 operationType, 
            address target, 
            uint256 execValue, 
            bytes memory execData, 
            bytes memory newDataAfterExec
        )
    {
        // 1. Fetch config from UP
        IERC725Y upERC725Y = IERC725Y(upAddress);
        bytes32 settingsKey = _computeSettingsKey(address(this));
        bytes memory settings = upERC725Y.getData(settingsKey);
        if (settings.length == 0) {
            revert NoConfigFound();
        }

        // 2. Decode recipient
        address recipient = abi.decode(settings, (address));
        // 3. Forward 10% of the value
        uint256 forwardAmount = (value * 10) / 100;

        // 4. Return operation instructions
        // operationType = 0 (CALL), target = recipient, execValue = forwardAmount
        // no call data needed for a plain value transfer, so execData = ""
        // newDataAfterExec is the updated data for next assistant (we reduce the value by the forwardAmount)
        return (
            0, 
            recipient, 
            forwardAmount, 
            "", 
            abi.encode(value - forwardAmount, data)
        );
    }

    function _computeSettingsKey(address assistantAddr) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        // same pattern used in examples (UAPExecutiveConfig plus assistantAddr)
        bytes32 firstWordHash = keccak256(bytes("UAPExecutiveConfig"));
        bytes memory temp = bytes.concat(
            bytes10(firstWordHash),
            bytes2(0),
            bytes20(assistantAddr)
        );
        return bytes32(temp);
    }
}
```

**Configuration Steps**:

1. Deploy `MyCoolAssistant`.
2. Set `UAPTypeConfig:<typeId>` in your UP’s ERC725Y to include the address of `MyCoolAssistant`.
3. Store the “recipient” under the key `UAPExecutiveConfig:myCoolAssistantAddress`.

With that, whenever a transfer or call with the matching `typeId` arrives, the URDuap will call `MyCoolAssistant.execute(...)`, which in turn forwards 10% of the provided `value` to the configured recipient.

### Final Thoughts

* Reach out to the YearOne team for integrating the Executive Assistant you build directly into the https://upassistants.com UI.
* **Executive Assistants** give developers modular, composable “plugins” to process incoming transactions on a Universal Profile.
* By storing or reading settings from the UP’s `ERC725Y` data store, you can create highly configurable logic for specific token types (`typeId`), event types, or other scenarios.
* Always design and **test** your Assistants carefully to avoid security pitfalls or unexpected behaviors.

This is an evolving ecosystem, and future releases will add **Screener Assistants**, which will act as gatekeepers before any Executive Assistant logic is invoked. Until then, the approach outlined here (implementing `IExecutiveAssistant` and registering your contract under a `typeId`) is the primary way to integrate with the UAP.
