# Future proposal: Screener Assistants

**Screener Assistants** will be introduced in a future release.

They are intended to:

* Act as a gatekeeper to incoming transactions before Executive Assistants run.
* Potentially block, modify, or augment the transaction data/`value` if certain conditions are met.

The final architecture is **TBD**. Stay tuned for updates.
