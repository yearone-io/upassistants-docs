# Quickstart

To get started, head to [https://upassistants.com/](https://upassistants.com/) to setup your UP profile for using UP Assistants

## Sign in



We currently support the rich experience facilitated by Universal Profiles through the Universal Profiles [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/universal-profiles/abpickdkkbnbcoepogfhkhennhfhehfn?hl=en) on LUKSO.

## Give the UP Browser Extension the necessary permissions to subscribe to the protocol

For the purposes of this demo, we'll install the protocol via the Tip Assistant.&#x20;

This step is required to allow UAP's Univeral Receiver to be installed on your ðŸ†™\

## Install the Universal Assistant Protocol on your ðŸ†™

This step sets UAP's Universal Receiver Delegate to handle LSP0, LSP6 and LSP7 transactions on your behalf, depending on which Universal Assistants you have installed. Installing the protocol by itself will not change any existing behavior on your Universal Profile without installing the actual assistant (next step). The exception to this is the unlikely case that you have already installed a Universal Receiver Delegate in which case this will replace it.

## Configure and activate assistants

Once the protocol is successfully installed on your ðŸ†™, you'll see a configuration screen specific to that assistant. In this case the Tip Assistant allows you to transfer a percentage of LYX received on your ðŸ†™ to another wallet. This might be useful to have a "savings" wallet or tip a community wallet.
